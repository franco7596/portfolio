## Portfolio
Welcome to the repository of my project! This project was developed using React.js to showcase my programming skills. It is a portfolio that displays my professional information, including my work experience and the projects I have been working on. Additionally, the portfolio was designed to be fully responsive, which means it can adapt to any screen size or device. This ensures that anyone viewing my portfolio on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device will have a seamless experience. With a responsive design, I can showcase my work to a wider audience and make it accessible to anyone, anywhere. The page is deployed on Vercel using my own personal domain, which is "[www.ribotta-franco.com](https://www.ribotta-franco.com/)". I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio, and thank you for visiting this repository
